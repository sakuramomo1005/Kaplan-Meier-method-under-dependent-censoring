* MLE stanford: MLE basic knowledge

* RES.RData: data (vector) saved from grid search of $g(\rho)$ function. $\rho$ varies from 0.1 to 3 by 0.1

* rrr0822.RData: input different $\rho$ values, calculate the $S(t)$. The dataset is 1000. However it takes to long time to run. For each $\rho$, only the first 500 time points were used to calculate the $\hat S(t)$

* try mle 2019-08-22.R: R file. Calculated the MLE, grid search, and how $\rho$ affect $\hat S(t)$. where the $S(t)$ is generated by true $\rho = 0.1$

* try MLE.Rmd: summary
