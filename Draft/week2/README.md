 * 1988
 * Cited Slud's paper by using its idea that KM is inappropriate for dependent censor.

### Statistical methods for dependent competing risks

* 1995
* This paper has attempted to trace the historical efforts of the development of the statistical
methods for dependent competing risks to the present time.
* Cited Slud's work to show one method for dependent censor.

### A Weibull Model for Dependent Censoring

* 1990
* Cited Slud paper in the introduction:
  * Peterson (1976) gave worst case bounds on the survival distribution without any assumptions. Williams and Lagakos (1977) provided conditions for the Kaplan-Meier estimator to be consistent even in the presence of dependence. Slud and Rubenstein (1983) gave bounds based on specific knowledge about hazard ratios. Robertson and Uppuluri (1984) extended the Kaplan-Meier estimator to nonparametric estimates with depen- dent margins. Klein and Moeschberger (1984) assumed a particular form of dependence and gave bounds on the survival distribution in that case.
  
 ### On semi-competing risks data

 * 2001
 * Mentioned some cons for the method: complex, restrictive conditions, need some other assumptions

* 2007
* Slud's method not widely used:
  * Correcting the KM Estimate: Some methods to overcome the limitations of informative censoring have been suggested [20 â€“22], but they are rarely used in the cardiac literature, and the incorrect KM method is used instead. One method of adjusting for informative\ censoring, called inverse probability weighting (IPW) 



ps competing event, usually termed a competing risk, means censoring
