Literature review of ...


## Week 2

* 2019-04-24 to 2019-05-01

Search and read the papers who cited the paper


## Week 3 

* 2019-05-01 to 2019-05-08

Tried a simple simulation, however there is a big error. In Slud's formula, it works when there is no tied time. I generated data and calculated round, which makes the formula work not well.

Need to simulate a data from a joint distribution and try whether the iterations can work between the two formula. 


## Week 4

* 2019-05-08 to 2019-05-22

Simulated joint distribution from f(s,t) = 1/1000 (s + t).
Calculate rho, there is an error in estimating the phi function. 

Try the correct estimation and check whether it converges: the paper a large sample study of the life table and prodcut limit estimates under random censorship
