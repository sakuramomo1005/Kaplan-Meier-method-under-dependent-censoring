1. Whether there is bias when the censoring is informative?

*  *Impact of Informative Censoring on the Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Progression-Free Survival in Phase II Clinical Trials*

   * A simulation study on 2014
   
   *  Brief conclusion: 
The simulations show that the magnitude of the bias depends primar- ily on the proportion of patients who are informatively censored and secondarily on the hazard ratio between those who are informatively censored and those who remain on study.


2. Alternative method?

* *A Model for Informative Censoring* [paper link](https://github.com/sakuramomo1005/Kaplan-Meier-method-under-dependent-censoring/blob/master/Draft/week1/papers/A%20Model%20for%20Informative%20Censoring.pdf)
   
   * 1989
   
   * Introduce a new method: modified Kaplan-Meier estimator (MKME).

   * An additional assumption: censoring only happens in high risk subpopulation.  
   
   * It mentioned that: "Williams and Lagakos (1977) and Lagakos and Williams (1978) defined a "cone-class" of censoring models that are indexed by a parameter $\theta \in$ [0, 1]. When $\theta$= 0, censoring immediately precedes death; fI is the appropriate esti- mator of S(Â·). When $\theta$ = 1, the KME is the appropriate estimator."
