1. Whether there is bias when the censoring is informative?

*  *Impact of Informative Censoring on the Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Progression-Free Survival in Phase II Clinical Trials*
[the paper link](https://github.com/sakuramomo1005/Kaplan-Meier-method-under-dependent-censoring/blob/master/Draft/week1/papers/Impact%20of%20Informative%20Censoring%20on%20the%20Kaplan-Meier%20Estimate%20of%20Progression-Free%20Survival%20in%20Phase%20II%20Clinical%20Trials.pdf)
   * A simulation study on 2014
   *  Brief conclusion: 
The simulations show that the magnitude of the bias depends primar- ily on the proportion of patients who are informatively censored and secondarily on the hazard ratio between those who are informatively censored and those who remain on study.

* *Nonparametric estimation of successive duration times under dependent censoring*

2. Alternative method?

* *A Model for Informative Censoring* [paper link](https://github.com/sakuramomo1005/Kaplan-Meier-method-under-dependent-censoring/blob/master/Draft/week1/papers/A%20Model%20for%20Informative%20Censoring.pdf)
   * 1989
   * Introduce a new method: modified Kaplan-Meier estimator (MKME).
   * An additional assumption: censoring only happens in high risk subpopulation.  
   * It mentioned that: "Williams and Lagakos (1977) and Lagakos and Williams (1978) defined a "cone-class" of censoring models that are indexed by a parameter  <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\theta&space;\in&space;[0,1]]" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\theta&space;\in&space;[0,1]]" title="\theta \in [0,1]]" /></a>
. When <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\theta&space;=&space;0$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\theta&space;=&space;0$" title="$\theta = 0$" /></a> , censoring immediately precedes death; H_{hat} is the appropriate estimator of S(Â·). When $\theta$ = 1, the KME is the appropriate estimator."
